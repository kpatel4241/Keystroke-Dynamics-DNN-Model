# Keystroke-Dynamics-DNN-Model


What is Keystroke Dynamics ?
============================
Keystroke dynamics is the study of whether people can be distinguished by their typing rhythms, much like handwriting is used to identify the author of a written text. Possible applications include acting as an electronic fingerprint, or in an access-control mechanism. A digital fingerprint would tie a person to a computer-based crime in the same manner that a physical fingerprint ties a person to the scene of a physical crime. Access control could incorporate keystroke dynamics both by requiring a legitimate user to type a password with the correct rhythm, and by continually authenticating that user while they type on the keyboard.

Implementation
===============
For creating this model we used the concept of Deep Neural Network and implemented the same with Tensorflow Keras. You can find everything in the IPython notebook.
